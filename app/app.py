Harmful algal blooms pose significant threats to aquatic ecosystems and public health. Motivated by the need for an effective solution, AquaWatch employs advanced image classification techniques to discern various algae species and assess potential environmental risks. The project aims to contribute to water quality monitoring and enhance early warning systems.'

By creating this model, we are dedicated to reducing the impact of harmful algae exposure, which can result in irritations and health issues. Our goal is to safeguard habitats, preserve water quality, and enhance the overall safety of recreational activities.'

    source_text = 'The project draws from diverse datasets, including Harmful Algal Bloom Datasets, Clear Lake Cyanotoxin Issues, Harmful Cyanobacterial Bloom Advisories in Wyoming Waters, and Algal Bloom Sampling Status in Florida Water. Leveraging these datasets, AquaWatch utilizes a two-stepped multi-binary ResNet model for image classification. The model is trained to initially classify algae as non-advisory or advisory and subsequently categorize advisory algae into caution or danger. The approach involves extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the exploration of various model architectures. Feature engineering involves preprocessing and augmenting images, including resizing, pixel normalization, rotation, shifting, flipping, and adjustments to brightness and contrast.'
